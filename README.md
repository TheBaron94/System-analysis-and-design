Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for the DriverPass project was Liam the owner of DriverPass and his IT officer, Ian. They wanted a cloud-based online program to handle appt scheduling as well as asset tracking and reporting, online classes, and online practice tests to help coach new drivers to pass the DMV licensing test

What did you do particularly well?
  I think i did quite well at capturing the customers needs from the given interview transcript as well as translating those needs into usable documentation and diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I feel the use case diagram could have been more in depth, at the time I went with a very highlevel view, but later on in the course I felt that a more detailed view would have been helpful in my work.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The user stated that they needed the system to:
  *Allow access from anywhere online, desktop and mobile
	*Ability to download reports and information
	*Have different types of account access level
	*Reportable change tracking
	*Online lesson registration
	*Modular design for future expansions
	*Account setup, done over the phone with a representative
	*DMV change compliance
	*Web based, running on cloud*
  I implemented these needs by considering how best to potential implement them and then wrote and designed all documentation around meeting these needs.
 It is always important to consider the user's needs when designing a system for them because with out the users needs, they wouldn't need you to design a system.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  My approach is something id consider to be fairly organic, i sketch out charts in pencil starting with core functions and features and slowly expand and adjust to incorporate all of the client needs that can be addressed.
